I'm a computer science major at CSU Fullerton and I expect to graduate in the year 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 1
This was one of my favorite labs because we were introduced to the very basics of coding. I had to learn how to follow coding guidelines. Once I got the hang of it, I could easily print out "Hello World!" with ease. I really liked how easy and straightforward it was.

Lab 2
This was my second favorite lab because it was easy and fun to do. I had to learn how to clone a GitHub repository, how to make changes to it, commit, and push for the changes I made. I also learned how to write well-formatted programs and edit them. What I liked about this lab is that you finally get to learn more and be hands-on at the same time with almost no difficulty.

Lab 3
This was my third favorite because it started exploring more onto the sophiscated stuff, like variables, initializations, inputs, outputs, arithmetic operators, and functions. I also learned about using "make" to compile, and using unit tests to ensure that my work is correct. I liked how it was much more in-depth, but not enough to be difficult to follow.
